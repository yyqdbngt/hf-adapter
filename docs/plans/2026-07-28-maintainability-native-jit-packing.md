# Native JIT packing split

> **Historical implementation plan.** This records the stacked change at its
> original review point; current ownership lives in
> [`../architecture/REPOSITORY_LAYOUT.md`](../architecture/REPOSITORY_LAYOUT.md).

Status: sixth stacked structural change.

## Scope

Move dense/graph pack construction and recurrent-state allocation from
`native_jit.py` into `native_jit_packing.py`.

## Invariants

- Dense and graph pack tuple order, length and tensor/module ownership remain
  unchanged.
- `extract` and `extract_graph` retain device guards in the stable facade.
- Runtime policy and linear adapters are passed from the facade, preserving
  downstream monkeypatch behavior.
- State allocation helpers remain direct aliases and add no decode overhead.
- Remote-code adapter closure includes the new implementation module.
