# Native JIT BnB W8 split

> **Historical implementation plan.** This records the stacked change at its
> original review point; current ownership lives in
> [`../architecture/REPOSITORY_LAYOUT.md`](../architecture/REPOSITORY_LAYOUT.md).

Status: fourth stacked structural change; local and RTX 4080 regression gates
pass.

## Scope

Move BnB W8 module detection, policy lookup, threshold-zero direct operators,
prequantized linear dispatch and fused activation-quantization eligibility from
`native_jit.py` into `native_jit_bnb8.py`.

## Invariants

- Existing private names remain importable from `rwkv7_hf.native_jit`.
- Hot helpers are direct aliases, not compatibility wrappers.
- Training, gradient, outlier-threshold and non-BnB fallbacks stay unchanged.
- Existing BnB operators, activation fusion and block-size policy stay intact.
- No dense, MM8, MM4, recurrent, prefill or decode math changes.
- The module is present in the adapter manifest and direct remote-code closure.

## Regression gates

python -m pytest -q -m 'cpu and not slow and not model_required'

git diff --check
```

## RTX 4080 gate

The existing BnB W8 correctness, VRAM and B1/B8 performance lane was run on an
RTX 4080 against direct parent `89bc457`. Real-CUDA helper tests pass, output
correctness and memory are unchanged, and all prefill/decode movement remains
within 1.1%. Evidence and the explicit remaining full-model BnB speed gap are
recorded in
[`../../bench/4080_bnb8_refactor_20260728/README.md`](../../bench/4080_bnb8_refactor_20260728/README.md).
