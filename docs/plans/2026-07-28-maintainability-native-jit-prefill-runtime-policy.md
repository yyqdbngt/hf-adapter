# Native JIT prefill runtime policy split

> **Historical implementation plan.** This records the stacked change at its
> original review point; current ownership lives in
> [`../architecture/REPOSITORY_LAYOUT.md`](../architecture/REPOSITORY_LAYOUT.md).

Status: eighth stacked structural change.

## Scope

Move prefill kernel eligibility, exact-card feature gates, tile selection and
launch policy from `native_jit.py` into
`native_jit_prefill_runtime_policy.py`.

## Invariants

- Mathematical prefill execution remains in the runtime engine.
- Existing private names remain callable from `native_jit`.
- Facade policy and optional-kernel monkeypatches remain observable, including
  overrides of one policy helper used by another.
- Environment and exact-card precedence remain unchanged.
- The module is included in the remote-code adapter closure.
