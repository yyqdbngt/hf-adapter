# Documentation map

The documentation is organized around a small canonical layer. Read that layer
first; detailed platform documents and dated benchmark artifacts provide depth
and history.

## Source-of-truth order

If documents appear to conflict, use this order:

1. Raw dated artifact (`bench/<topic>_<hardware>_<date>/`), including JSONL/logs.
2. Current promoted numeric summary ([`../BENCHMARK.md`](../BENCHMARK.md)).
3. Canonical status/acceptance documents in the table above.
4. Platform detail and engineering-roadmap documents.
5. Historical prose and Git history.

A newer experiment does not automatically replace a promoted result. Promotion
requires compatible shape/reference, correctness and reproducible evidence.
Likewise, completion is reported for a named scope. The completed current
milestone must not be conflated with the still-partial universal production
scope, and roadmap checkbox counts must not be converted into a global
percentage.

## Document lifecycle

Use the title/date and the following classes when interpreting prose:

| Class | Meaning | May override current status? |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical | Root status/TODO/benchmark plus `ACCEPTANCE`, `HARDWARE_MATRIX`, `PERFORMANCE`, `QUANTIZATION`, `TRAINING` | Yes, subject to newer raw accepted evidence |
| Current engineering reference | Backend/runtime architecture and active kernel roadmaps | Only for implementation direction, not measured status |
| Dated validation snapshot | Exact-card validation documents and dated benchmark artifacts | Only for the exact recorded scope |
| Historical plan/investigation | `docs/plans`, `docs/archive`, dated live notes and superseded summaries | No; preserve for rationale and chronology |

Words such as “current”, “next” and “open” inside a historical document refer
to that document's date unless a banner explicitly promotes the statement.
Dated benchmark artifacts are evidence records and should not be rewritten to
match later outcomes.

| Apple/Qwen dated investigation | [`hardware/APPLE_QWEN35_LIVE_EVIDENCE_20260707.md`](hardware/APPLE_QWEN35_LIVE_EVIDENCE_20260707.md) | Historical 2026-07-07 blocker record; use the production-close page for current conclusions |

Platform detail files contain experiment chronology and may include superseded
or negative rows. Their promoted conclusion must agree with the canonical
matrix and benchmark summary.

## Benchmark evidence workflow

1. Create `bench/<topic>_<hardware>_<YYYYMMDD>/`.
2. Include a concise README, exact command, environment, raw JSONL and logs.
3. Run correctness, speed and memory gates together.
4. Add the artifact to [`../bench/INDEX.md`](../bench/INDEX.md).
5. Promote only current conclusions to [`../BENCHMARK.md`](../BENCHMARK.md).
6. Update status/TODO only when the accepted state actually changes.

See [`../bench/README.md`](../bench/README.md) for the complete artifact rules.

## Scope boundaries

This repository delivers the Hugging Face adapter. HF cache helpers and
serving-like tests are in scope; native vLLM/SGLang scheduling and engine-level
PP/TP implementations are separate projects. Apple MLX/CoreML is retained as a
hardware backend lane because it validates the same converted model and HF
compatibility contract.
